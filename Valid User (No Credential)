# Active Directory Attacks - Valid User (No Password)

Techniques to exploit or escalate when you have a list of valid usernames but no passwords.  
Focus: Password spraying (low-noise brute force) and AS-REPRoasting (pre-auth disabled accounts).

## Password Policy Enumeration (Critical First Step)

Always check the domain password policy first to avoid account lockouts during spraying.

### Default Domain Policy
```bash
# NetExec (requires valid creds for full info)
nxc smb <dc_ip> -u '<user>' -p '<password>' --pass-pol

# PowerView / AD Module (from Windows host with creds)
Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy

# ldeep (LDAP query)
ldeep ldap -u <user> -p <password> -d <domain> -s ldap://<dc_ip> domain_policy
```

```bash
